I work at the interface between **computational solid mechanics** and **scientific machine learning**. My group focuses on developing new simulation tools for modeling the behavior of complex materials. By combining advances in surrogate modeling, Bayesian machine learning and generative learning with Finite Element simulations, my research enables fast and accurate multiscale modeling of materials, uncertainty quantification of material behavior and the (multiscale) design of new materials. Other than developing new numerical simulation tools, I also work on applying them to real-life problems in material modeling and design, in collaboration with academic and industrial partners.

I am co-director of the <a href='https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/slimmlab'>SLIMM Lab</a> and part of the <a href='https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ai/tu-delft-ai-initiative'>TU Delft AI Initiative</a>. I teach machine learning and computational mechanics topics at several MSc-level courses at the CEG Faculty of TU Delft.
