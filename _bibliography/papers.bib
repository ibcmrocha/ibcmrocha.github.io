abstract = {Driven by the need to accelerate numerical simulations, the use of machine learning techniques is rapidly growing in the field of computational solid mechanics. Their application is especially advantageous in concurrent multiscale finite element analysis (FE2) due to the exceedingly high computational costs often associated with it and the high number of similar micromechanical analyses involved. To tackle the issue, using surrogate models to approximate the microscopic behavior and accelerate the simulations is a promising and increasingly popular strategy. However, several challenges related to their data-driven nature compromise the reliability of surrogate models in material modeling. The alternative explored in this work is to reintroduce some of the physics-based knowledge of classical constitutive modeling into a neural network by employing the actual material models used in the full-order micromodel to introduce non-linearity. Thus, path-dependency arises naturally since every material model in the layer keeps track of its own internal variables. For the numerical examples, a composite Representative Volume Element with elastic fibers and elasto-plastic matrix material is used as the microscopic model. The network is tested in a series of challenging scenarios and its performance is compared to that of a state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A remarkable outcome of the novel framework is the ability to naturally predict unloading/reloading behavior without ever seeing it during training, a stark contrast with popular but data-hungry models such as RNNs. Finally, the proposed network is applied to FE2 examples to assess its robustness for application in nonlinear finite element analysis.},

abstract = {Bayesian system identification is increasingly used in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) to infer unobservable parameters of a structure from sensor data. The use of spatially dense measurements, such as those from distributed fibre optic sensors, can further enhance the results of Bayesian system identification due to the large volume of data. However, this combination faces two major challenges: the computational cost of inference and the correlation structure of closely spaced data points. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a methodology that combines the recently-developed Variational Bayes Monte Carlo (VBMC) method with Gaussian process modelling of model discrepancy, and extend VBMC to enable posterior predictive calculations without additional model evaluations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on a reinforced concrete slab bridge instrumented with distributed fibre optic strain sensors and analysed using a finite element model. The main outcome is that VBMC requires fewer than 200 finite element model evaluations while producing accurate estimates, whereas a conventional MCMC method requires thousands. The application of the proposed framework provides two additional novel insights: accounting for spatial correlations improves model performance and higher measurement resolution leads to more precise parameter estimates, though with limited impact on predictive accuracy. This study advances the practical implementation of Bayesian system identification in SHM by providing both the computational efficiency and statistical framework needed for modern sensing technologies.},

abstract = {In this work, we extend a recent surrogate modeling approach, the Physically Recurrent Neural Network (PRNN), to include the effect of debonding at the fiber–matrix interface of composite materials. The core idea of the PRNN is to implement the exact material models from the micromodel into one of the layers of the network to capture path-dependent behavior implicitly. For the case of debonding, additional material points with a cohesive zone model are integrated within the network, along with the bulk points associated to the fibers and/or matrix. The limitations of the existing architecture are discussed and taken into account for the development of novel architectures that better represent the stress homogenization procedure. In the proposed layout, the history variables of cohesive points act as extra latent features that help determine the local strains of bulk points. Different architectures are evaluated starting with small training datasets. To maximize the predictive accuracy and extrapolation capabilities of the network, various configurations of bulk and cohesive points are explored, along with different training dataset types and sizes.},

      abstract = {When using the finite element method (FEM) in inverse problems, its discretization error can produce parameter estimates that are inaccurate and overconfident. The Bayesian finite element method (BFEM) provides a probabilistic model for the epistemic uncertainty due to discretization error. In this work, we apply BFEM to various inverse problems, and compare its performance to the random mesh finite element method (RM-FEM) and the statistical finite element method (statFEM), which serve as a frequentist and inference-based counterpart to BFEM. We find that by propagating this uncertainty to the posterior, BFEM can produce more accurate parameter estimates and prevent overconfidence, compared to FEM. Because the BFEM covariance operator is designed to leave uncertainty only in the appropriate space, orthogonal to the FEM basis, BFEM is able to outperform RM-FEM, which does not have such a structure to its covariance. Although inferring the discretization error via a model misspecification component is possible as well, as is done in statFEM, the feasibility of such an approach is contingent on the availability of sufficient data. We find that the BFEM is the most robust way to consistently propagate uncertainty due to discretization error to the posterior of a Bayesian inverse problem.},

      abstract = {There is a high interest in accelerating multiscale models using data-driven surrogate modeling techniques. Creating a large training dataset encompassing all relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the computational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor. Commonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain. Here, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast probabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts back to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not required to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a significant reduction in the data collection time. We achieve this by creating phases in the computational domain corresponding to the different models. These phases evolve using a phase-field model driven by the surrogate uncertainty. When the surrogate uncertainty becomes large, the phase-field model causes a local transition from the surrogate to the high-fidelity model, maintaining a highly accurate simulation. We discuss the requirements of this approach to achieve accurate and numerically stable results and compare the phase-field model to a purely local approach that does not enforce spatial smoothness for the phase mixing. Using a Gaussian Process surrogate for an elasto-plastic material, we demonstrate the potential of this mixture of models to accelerate multiscale simulations.},

      abstract = {This study investigates whether Physically Recurrent Neural Networks (PRNNs), a recent surrogate model for heterogeneous materials, trained on a micromodel with fixed material parameters, can maintain accuracy for varying material properties without retraining, and propagate uncertainty in a multiscale framework. Unlike conventional RNNs, where parameter changes require training or explicit inclusion of material properties as extra input features, PRNNs embeds material models in their material layer that allow for modification of material parameters after training. When adjusting material properties dynamically according to the input during testing, PRNN shows high accuracy across a wide range of parameters. Therefore the surrogate can be applied to multiscale uncertainty quantification (UQ). Compared to the full-order simulations on an overly coarse mesh, the PRNN-driven model reduces simulation time by over 7000 times while accurately capturing highly nonlinear evolution of the probability density for the macroscopic response as a result of a given distribution for microscale material parameters. A PRNN-driven UQ is demonstrated on a more accurate finer mesh that would be computationally infeasible with the full-order model.},
