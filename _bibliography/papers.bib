abstract = {Driven by the need to accelerate numerical simulations, the use of machine learning techniques is rapidly growing in the field of computational solid mechanics. Their application is especially advantageous in concurrent multiscale finite element analysis (FE2) due to the exceedingly high computational costs often associated with it and the high number of similar micromechanical analyses involved. To tackle the issue, using surrogate models to approximate the microscopic behavior and accelerate the simulations is a promising and increasingly popular strategy. However, several challenges related to their data-driven nature compromise the reliability of surrogate models in material modeling. The alternative explored in this work is to reintroduce some of the physics-based knowledge of classical constitutive modeling into a neural network by employing the actual material models used in the full-order micromodel to introduce non-linearity. Thus, path-dependency arises naturally since every material model in the layer keeps track of its own internal variables. For the numerical examples, a composite Representative Volume Element with elastic fibers and elasto-plastic matrix material is used as the microscopic model. The network is tested in a series of challenging scenarios and its performance is compared to that of a state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A remarkable outcome of the novel framework is the ability to naturally predict unloading/reloading behavior without ever seeing it during training, a stark contrast with popular but data-hungry models such as RNNs. Finally, the proposed network is applied to FE2 examples to assess its robustness for application in nonlinear finite element analysis.},

abstract = {Bayesian system identification is increasingly used in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) to infer unobservable parameters of a structure from sensor data. The use of spatially dense measurements, such as those from distributed fibre optic sensors, can further enhance the results of Bayesian system identification due to the large volume of data. However, this combination faces two major challenges: the computational cost of inference and the correlation structure of closely spaced data points. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a methodology that combines the recently-developed Variational Bayes Monte Carlo (VBMC) method with Gaussian process modelling of model discrepancy, and extend VBMC to enable posterior predictive calculations without additional model evaluations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on a reinforced concrete slab bridge instrumented with distributed fibre optic strain sensors and analysed using a finite element model. The main outcome is that VBMC requires fewer than 200 finite element model evaluations while producing accurate estimates, whereas a conventional MCMC method requires thousands. The application of the proposed framework provides two additional novel insights: accounting for spatial correlations improves model performance and higher measurement resolution leads to more precise parameter estimates, though with limited impact on predictive accuracy. This study advances the practical implementation of Bayesian system identification in SHM by providing both the computational efficiency and statistical framework needed for modern sensing technologies.},

The core idea of the PRNN is to implement the exact material models from the micromodel into one of the layers of the network to capture path-dependent behavior implicitly. For the case of debonding, additional material points with a cohesive zone model are integrated within the network, along with the bulk points associated to the fibers and/or matrix. The limitations of the existing architecture are discussed and taken into account for the development of novel architectures that better represent the stress homogenization procedure. In the proposed layout, the history variables of cohesive points act as extra latent features that help determine the local strains of bulk points. Different architectures are evaluated starting with small training datasets. To maximize the predictive accuracy and extrapolation capabilities of the network, various configurations of bulk and cohesive points are explored, along with different training dataset types and sizes.},

      abstract = {When using the finite element method (FEM) in inverse problems, its discretization error can produce parameter estimates that are inaccurate and overconfident. The Bayesian finite element method (BFEM) provides a probabilistic model for the epistemic uncertainty due to discretization error. In this work, we apply BFEM to various inverse problems, and compare its performance to the random mesh finite element method (RM-FEM) and the statistical finite element method (statFEM), which serve as a frequentist and inference-based counterpart to BFEM. We find that by propagating this uncertainty to the posterior, BFEM can produce more accurate parameter estimates and prevent overconfidence, compared to FEM. Because the BFEM covariance operator is designed to leave uncertainty only in the appropriate space, orthogonal to the FEM basis, BFEM is able to outperform RM-FEM, which does not have such a structure to its covariance. Although inferring the discretization error via a model misspecification component is possible as well, as is done in statFEM, the feasibility of such an approach is contingent on the availability of sufficient data. We find that the BFEM is the most robust way to consistently propagate uncertainty due to discretization error to the posterior of a Bayesian inverse problem.},

      abstract = {There is a high interest in accelerating multiscale models using data-driven surrogate modeling techniques. Creating a large training dataset encompassing all relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the computational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor. Commonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain. Here, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast probabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts back to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not required to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a significant reduction in the data collection time. We achieve this by creating phases in the computational domain corresponding to the different models. These phases evolve using a phase-field model driven by the surrogate uncertainty. When the surrogate uncertainty becomes large, the phase-field model causes a local transition from the surrogate to the high-fidelity model, maintaining a highly accurate simulation. We discuss the requirements of this approach to achieve accurate and numerically stable results and compare the phase-field model to a purely local approach that does not enforce spatial smoothness for the phase mixing. Using a Gaussian Process surrogate for an elasto-plastic material, we demonstrate the potential of this mixture of models to accelerate multiscale simulations.},

Unlike conventional RNNs, where parameter changes require training or explicit inclusion of material properties as extra input features, PRNNs embeds material models in their material layer that allow for modification of material parameters after training. When adjusting material properties dynamically according to the input during testing, PRNN shows high accuracy across a wide range of parameters. Therefore the surrogate can be applied to multiscale uncertainty quantification (UQ). Compared to the full-order simulations on an overly coarse mesh, the PRNN-driven model reduces simulation time by over 7000 times while accurately capturing highly nonlinear evolution of the probability density for the macroscopic response as a result of a given distribution for microscale material parameters. A PRNN-driven UQ is demonstrated on a more accurate finer mesh that would be computationally infeasible with the full-order model.},

Data-driven surrogate models based on neural networks address this challenge but often suffer from big data requirements, limited interpretability, and poor extrapolation capabilities. This study introduces a Hierarchical Physically Recurrent Neural Network (HPRNN) employing two levels of surrogate modeling. First, Physically Recurrent Neural Networks (PRNNs) are trained to capture the nonlinear elasto-plastic behavior of warp and weft yarns using micromechanical data. In a second scale transition, a physics-encoded meso-to-macroscale model integrates these yarn surrogates with the matrix constitutive model, embedding physical properties directly into the latent space. Adopting HPRNNs for both scale transitions can avoid nonphysical behavior often observed in predictions from pure data-driven recurrent neural networks and transformer networks. This results in better generalization under complex cyclic loading conditions. The framework offers a computationally efficient and explainable solution for multiscale modeling of woven composites.},

      abstract={In this paper, we present a surrogate-based multiscale approach to model constant strain-rate and creep experiments on unidirectional thermoplastic composites under off-axis loading. In previous contributions, these experiments were modeled through a single-scale micromechanical simulation under the assumption of macroscopic homogeneity. Although efficient and accurate in many scenarios, simulations with low-off axis angles showed significant discrepancies with the experiments. It was hypothesized that the mismatch was caused by macroscopic inhomogeneity, which would require a multiscale approach to capture it. However, full-field multiscale simulations remain computationally prohibitive. To address this issue, we replace the micromodel with a Physically Recurrent Neural Network (PRNN), a surrogate model that combines data-driven components with embedded constitutive models to capture history-dependent behavior naturally. The explainability of the latent space of this network is also explored in a transfer learning strategy that requires no re-training. With the surrogate-based simulations, we confirm the hypothesis raised on the inhomogeneity of the macroscopic strain field and gain insights into the influence of adjustment of the experimental setup with oblique end-tabs. Results from the surrogate-based multiscale approach show better agreement with experiments than the single-scale micromechanical approach over a wide range of settings, although with limited accuracy on the creep experiments, where macroscopic test effects were implicitly taken into account in the material properties calibration.},

abstract = {A micromechanical model for simulating failure of unidirectional composites under cyclic loading has been developed and tested. To efficiently pass through the loading signal, a two-scale temporal framework with adaptive stepping is proposed, with a varying step size between macro time steps, and a fixed number of equally spaced micro time steps in between. With the focus on matrix dominated failure under off-axis loading, viscoplasticity and microcracking are included in the model for the polymer matrix, while carbon fibers are modeled as elastic. For a proper representation of viscous deformation in the matrix under cyclic loading, a two-scale version of the Eindhoven Glassy Polymer constitutive model is formulated, that is based on time homogenization with an effective time increment. The failure state of the representative volume element is reached by the initiation and damaging of cohesive microcracks. Cyclic and static degradation are represented by using Dávila’s fatigue damage function, which is built on top of Turon’s quasi-static cohesive model. The model results are compared with available experimental data on unidirectional carbon/PEEK composites tested at different stress levels, load ratios, frequencies and off-axis angles. Plasticity controlled and crack growth controlled failure mechanisms, characteristic of the long-term response of polymeric composites, are captured by the model, as well as their distinct frequency dependence. As a limit case, the model is able to reproduce the time to failure in creep loading, where the heterogeneous microstructure and viscoplastic flow of the matrix trigger the evolution of quasi-static damage. However, for the studied material system, the present model does not accurately reproduce the load ratio dependence and the off-axis angle dependence of the crack growth controlled failure mechanism.},

However, the selection and integration of surrogate models and cutting-edge MCMC algorithms, often depend on ad-hoc decisions. A systematic assessment of their combined influence on analytical accuracy and efficiency is notably lacking. The present work offers a comprehensive comparative study, employing a scalable case study in computational mechanics focused on the inference of spatially varying material parameters, that sheds light on the impact of methodological choices for surrogate modelling and sampling. We show that a priori training of the surrogate model introduces large errors in the posterior estimation even in low to moderate dimensions. We introduce a simple active learning strategy based on the path of the MCMC algorithm that is superior to all a priori trained models, and determine its training data requirements. We demonstrate that the choice of the MCMC algorithm has only a small influence on the amount of training data but no significant influence on the accuracy of the resulting surrogate model. Further, we show that the accuracy of the posterior estimation largely depends on the surrogate model, but not even a tailored surrogate guarantees convergence of the this http URL, we identify the forward model as the bottleneck in the inference process, not the MCMC algorithm. While related works focus on employing advanced MCMC algorithms, we demonstrate that the training data requirements render the surrogate modelling approach infeasible before the benefits of these gradient-based MCMC algorithms on cheap models can be reaped.},

The proposed model benefits from the physics-based knowledge contained in the constitutive models used in the full-order micromodel by embedding the material models in a neural network. Following previous developments, this paper extends the applicability of the physically recurrent neural network (PRNN) by introducing an architecture suitable for rate-dependent materials in a finite strain framework. In this model, the homogenized deformation gradient of the micromodel is encoded into a set of deformation gradients serving as input to the embedded constitutive models. These constitutive models compute stresses, which are combined in a decoder to predict the homogenized stress, such that the internal variables of the history-dependent constitutive models naturally provide physics-based memory for the network. To demonstrate the capabilities of the surrogate model, we consider a unidirectional composite micromodel with transversely isotropic elastic fibers and elasto-viscoplastic matrix material. The extrapolation properties of the surrogate model trained to replace such micromodel are tested on loading scenarios unseen during training, ranging from different strain-rates to cyclic loading and relaxation. Speed-ups of three orders of magnitude with respect to the runtime of the original micromodel are obtained.},
